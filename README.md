# embedluac++

This set of examples illustrates how to embed Lua scripts into C/C++ applications. This example files are included in Visual Studio 2022 projects but the C/C++ and Lua code are easily portable to other environments.  An explanation of intent and context is posted at

This is a work in progress.  Expanded use by sample application(s) is pending.

Stock Lua library files (.c and .h) for 5.4 are included in the lualib directory and the copyrights to those files belong solely to the Lua project.  As of the time of this writing (2024-05-04) they also use the MIT license with the entity name "Lua.org, PUC-Rio" as stated at https://www.lua.org/license.html
